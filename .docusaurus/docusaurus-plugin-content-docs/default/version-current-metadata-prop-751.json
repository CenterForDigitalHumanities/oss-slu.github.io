Our center is funded by a grant from Alfred P. Sloan foundation and employs Computer Science graduate students to prototype, design, and deliver open-source software to help SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses join the center and work under the mentorship of our graduate students to contribute to ongoing projects.",
