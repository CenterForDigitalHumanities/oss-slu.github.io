Open Source with SLU was established to help SLU researchers with their custom software needs and to give students practical software development experience. The program is funded by a grant from Alfred P. Sloan foundation and employs Computer Science graduate students to prototype, design, and deliver open-source software to help SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU under the mentorship of our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

## Leadership Team

### Daniel Shown
