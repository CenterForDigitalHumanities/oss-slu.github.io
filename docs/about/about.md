Open Source with SLU was established to help SLU researchers with their custom software needs and to give students practical software development experience. The program is funded by a grant from Alfred P. Sloan foundation and employs Computer Science graduate students to prototype, design, and deliver open-source software to help SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU under the mentorship of our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

## Leadership Team

### Daniel Shown

Daniel Shown is the Program Director of the Open Source with SLU program. He handles the program's daily operations, builds connections with industry partners, works with internal and external clients of the program, guides and supports our graduate students. Daniel's focus is to ensure that the program follows its mission of research support, commitment to open-source, and providing students with relevant software development experience.

### Kate Holdener, Ph.D.

Kate Holdener is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Saint Louis University. Her main focus in the department is on software engineering courses. She founded the open-source software program in an effort to engage more student in open-source development, as a way to give them practical experience during school.

## Graduate Students

Graduate students are at the heart of our open-sourâ€‹ce program. They work with SLU researchers to understand their software needs, iterate on software prototypes, and deliver proof of concept solutions. Graduate students lead and mentor our undergraduate open-source developers.
